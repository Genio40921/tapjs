The API presented in test programs is the combination of the base
class defined by `@tapjs/core` and all [plugins](./plugins.md)
that are currently loaded.

By default, a set of plugins are included with `tap`, providing
the most common utilities that tests will need to use.

The methods and properties are documented in detail [in the
generated
TypeDocs](https://tapjs.github.io/tapjs/classes/_tapjs_test.index.Test.html)
for the `Test` class.

See [TAP Basics](./basics.md) for information about using these
objects to write tests.
