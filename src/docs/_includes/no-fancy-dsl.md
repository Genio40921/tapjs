### No Fancy DSL to Learn

The API is simple, but powerful. `t.test()` and a few
[assertions](./plugins/asserts.md) are all you really need.
Everything is statically typed, so your editor can tell
you what's available. Remember less, just write some tests.

(And there is actualy a [fancy DSL](/plugins/mocha-globals), if
you're into that.)
