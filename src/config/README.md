# @tapjs/stack

A comprehensive library for dealing with stack traces, supporting
source map lookup (when enabled in node with `--enable-source-maps`),
filtering of specified packages and/or Node.js internals, and
capturing call sites relative to a given function.

The descendant of [tapjs/stack-utils](https://github.com/tapjs/stack-utils).
