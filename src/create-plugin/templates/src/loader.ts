// Define resolve(), load(), etc in here, and export 'loader' from index.ts
// Note that if you export a globalPreload, it won't be run when loaded
// with --import, for that you'll have to use initialize. It can be good
// to split it up into a hooks.js file that defines them all, loader.js
// that exports load/resolve/globalPreload, and import-loader.js that
// exports load/resolve/initialize.
//
// See the node docs for more information, or the @tapjs/dummy-plugin
// for an example.
